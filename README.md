Subset of extremely common simplified Chinese characters that can be easily learned by speakers of any language, in order to communicate basic written ideas outside of spoken language and grammar.

I will add these as I learn them. The primary set will consist of the most common N symbols in chinese initialy, and the sub symbols they are comprised of.
